# Changelog

## Beta

-   💥 Breaking changes
    -   The file `/Library/Application Support/org.pqrs/tmp/karabiner_grabber_manipulator_environment.json` is no longer updated.
        You can still use EventViewer to check current variable values.
-   🐛 Bug Fixes
    -   Fixed an issue in EventViewer where new events were not added while the "Unknown Events" tab was open.
-   ✨ New Features
    -   Added a "Temporarily turns off all Karabiner-Elements modifications" toggle to EventViewer.
    -   Added a feature that lets you set environment variables via [`/Library/Application Support/org.pqrs/config/karabiner_environment`](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/docs/help/advanced-topics/set-environment-variables/).
    -   Added support for devices that expose the Programmable Buttons usage on the Consumer Usage Page. (e.g., VEC USB Footpedal)
    -   Added [`set_variable.expression` and `set_variable.key_up_expression`](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/docs/json/complex-modifications-manipulator-definition/to/set-variable/#expression-specification).
    -   Added [`expression_if` and `expression_unless`](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/docs/json/complex-modifications-manipulator-definition/conditions/expression/).
    -   Added `system.now.milliseconds` to variables.
    -   Added [`integer_value`](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/docs/json/complex-modifications-manipulator-definition/from/integer-value/) to the from event definition.

    -   Updated the app icon for macOS 26.
    -   Added support for Liquid Glass.

        In particular, CPU usage is lower when handling high-frequency events (e.g., mouse input).
    -   Improved handling of the `ignore_vendor_events` setting.
        The UI already prevented enabling this for Apple devices, and now, even if you manually set `ignore_vendor_events` in karabiner.json, vendor events for Apple devices will always be processed regardless of the setting.
    -   Adjusted the layouts in Settings and EventViewer to show more information.
    -   Supported the following keys:
        -   generic_desktop::system_app_menu
        -   consumer_key_code::microphone

-   🔔 Important Notes
    -   A unique random ID called `karabiner_machine_identifier` is now generated during installation.
        This ID is used for machine-specific settings and may be included in the karabiner.json file.
        If you are sharing karabiner.json with others, you might be interested in how this ID is generated and whether it is safe to share.
        Since it is a safe ID to share with others, and there is no need to mask it when you share karabiner.json with others.

### 🔔 Notes for Mac computers with Apple Silicon (Apple M1) users

macOS Big Sur 11.2 or earlier has an issue within memory management and HID device handling that causes kernel panics on Mac computers with Apple Silicon.
The virtual device that is used internally by Karabiner-Elements triggers this issue, and a kernel panic might be caused at macOS shutdown.

We confirmed that this issue has been fixed in [macOS Big Sur 11.3 Beta](https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/).
Please use macOS Big Sur 11.3 Beta or later versions if you are facing the kernel panic issue.
