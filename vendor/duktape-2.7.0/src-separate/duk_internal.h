 *  resolution, inclusion of system headers, etc.  These have been merged
 *  because the public API is also dependent on e.g. detecting appropriate
 *  C types which is quite platform/compiler specific especially for a non-C99
 *  build.  The public API is also dependent on the resolved feature set.
 *
 *  Some actions taken by the merged header (such as including system headers)
 *  are not appropriate for building a user application.  The define
 *  DUK_COMPILING_DUKTAPE allows the merged header to skip/include some
 *  sections depending on what is being built.
