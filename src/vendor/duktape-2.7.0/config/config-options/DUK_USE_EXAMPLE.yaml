#  Each Duktape option is described as a YAML file named OPTION_NAME.yaml.
#  YAML is used because it diffs well and has clean support for multiline
#  inline strings.

# C #define name for the option.  Must match filename minus extension.

# Duktape version number where this option was first introduced.
introduced: 1.1.0

# Optional Duktape version number where this option was deprecated,
# i.e. the option is supported but no longer recommended.
# XXX: automatic #error with some -DDUK_USE_NO_DEPRECATED flag?
#deprecated: 1.2.0

# Optional Duktape version number where this option was removed,
# i.e. the option is no longer supported but we may want to issue
# a clear #error for it.
#removed: 1.3.0

# Optional indication that config option is defined but currently
# unused, so that it can be omitted from generated header.

# When set to true, genconfig.py will warn if no forced value is provided.
# This should be used sparingly, for options which are really strongly
# recommended so that configure.py output should warn about it.

# Description for option, no newlines.  Line breaking for e.g. C header
# is automatic.
description: >
  Use a 16-bit object entry and array part sizes (for low memory
  environments).  Also automatically drops support for an object hash
  part to further reduce memory usage; there are rarely large objects
  in low memory environments simply because there's no memory to store
  a lot of properties.

  By default use "description: >" markup which works well for paragraphs
  (replacing newlines with spaces) but includes a trailing newline which
  is also a good default.
